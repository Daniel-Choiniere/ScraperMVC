After getting a Virtual Windows Machine setup yesterday I have been familiarizing myself with Visual Studio and the Windows enviroment. 
I have found a good walk through that I am going to go through today that will guide me through building a ASP.Net MVC app. 
I will be trying to finish that walkthrough today whiule applying what I learn towards my application.
